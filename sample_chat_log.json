INV-2023-10-26-001... okay, one sec! While I'm looking, did you know we just launched a new feature that lets you download all your invoices directly from your account? It's super easy! You can find it under 'Billing History'."

But hey, have you checked out our premium support package? It includes priority invoice retrieval, plus a dedicated account manager! It's a game-changer!"
